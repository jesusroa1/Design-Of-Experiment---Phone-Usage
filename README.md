# Design Of Experiment - Phone-Usage
In this project, I worked with a team to design a 2^3 full factorial experiment to test what factors increase your daily phone usage time. Spoiler alert: the only significant factor we found was including social media!

## Problem Statement:
The average American spends approximately 5 hours per day on their phone. I was no exception. Our team set out to find: **what are some things we can do to minimize the amount of time we spend on our phones?**

## Tools Used:
For this project, we utilized google sheets and JMP, a statistical analysis software.

## Experiment Design:
We used a 2 [^3] full factorial experiment that would test three distinct factors

1. Phone Unlock Difficulty
    - The thinking goes that if your phone is harder to unlock, you'll use it less
    - Easy Unlock entails using Face-ID, while a Hard Unlock requires using an 8 digit passcode to unlock your device
    
2. Social Media
    - This would test if by eliminating social media from your phone, screen time would go down
    
3. Greyscale
    - This involved setting your phone to black and white. 
    
## Data Collection:
We utilized a google sheets form to send out the randomized trials of phone configurations. Users would apply the phone configurations early sent out first thing in the morning. At 9PM, the users would fill out a google forms questionnare that asked their phone usage (users would get this from their phone's setting page).

## Results & Conclusions:

After validating our assumptions and residuals, we determined our Regression model was acceptable.

(Spoilers) Only Social Media ended up being statistically significant! In the future, there are so many other factors we would love to include such as boredome or phone type. Check out the powerpoint attached for more details!
